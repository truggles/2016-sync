First posting of Moriond17 sync sample from Tyler

Moriond17 sample: /AToZhToLLTauTau_M-300_13TeV_madgraph_4f_LO/RunIISummer16MiniAODv2-PUMoriond17_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6_ext1-v1/MINIAODSIM

This is based off of the baseline cuts found online at:

File with same everything as above except no electron energy regression applied. Checked that muon and tau pt are the same for common events, and electron pts change. The event yields change a tiny amount. It looks like ~40 events pass into/out of acceptance.

Same as directly above, but no trigger cuts are applied. This means we do not check if the trigger fired.  We do not check for matched leptons.  And because of that, we leave all pt cuts at their defalut levels (10 elec, 10 muon, 20 tau). This results in 771 events passing.  I did not dig into the details, but it is likely much of this is from the pt requirements being relaxed.
