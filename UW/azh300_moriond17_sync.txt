First posting of Moriond17 sync sample from Tyler

Moriond17 sample: /AToZhToLLTauTau_M-300_13TeV_madgraph_4f_LO/RunIISummer16MiniAODv2-PUMoriond17_80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6_ext1-v1/MINIAODSIM

This is based off of the baseline cuts found online at:

File with same everything as above except no electron energy regression applied. Checked that muon and tau pt are the same for common events, and electron pts change. The event yields change a tiny amount. It looks like ~40 events pass into/out of acceptance.

Same as directly above, but no trigger cuts are applied. This means we do not check if the trigger fired.  We do not check for matched leptons.  And because of that, we leave all pt cuts at their defalut levels (10 elec, 10 muon, 20 tau). This results in 771 events passing.  I did not dig into the details, but it is likely much of this is from the pt requirements being relaxed.

Identical to Aug 2, 2017 except the numGoodMuon variable has been updated to properly reflect our isolation and ID choices

Identical to Aug 7, 2017 except am not requiring that HLT trigger matching checks that matched leptons pass the last filter of the respective HLT path.  Only providing version with trigger cuts applied.

Adding remaining channels: EEET, EETT, EEEM, MMET, MMMT, MMTT, MMEM.  Same everything as Aug 9, 2017 #1
For comparison, let's begin by focusing on MMET and MMMT

Fixed missing trigger filter for 2nd doubleMuon trigger, all else the same as above, this gives near 100% sync with HIP in MMTT and MMET channels (1 additional event in HIP Ntuples).  I am also updating the MMMT and MMEM channels as well, but do not expect great sync on them from our discussion on Friday.

Updated dZ value in numGoodMuons, added missingHits to numGoodElectrons, and fixed a problem in FSA for Z boson candidates.  Two sets, with and without trigger cuts:

Only changed EEET as newest change only affects its event selection.  If Leg3 and Leg4
can both be reconstructed as electron and tau, choose Leg3 to be the higher Pt option

12 Sept, 2017
Updated electron ID/Iso WPs.  Electrons associated with Z boson only have to pass WP90 (no additional iso requirement).  Also updated Z boson requirement that the selected Z boson must be closer in mass to Z mass than any other possible OS Z configuration in that event (only applies to EEET,EEEM,MMMT,MMEM events).
