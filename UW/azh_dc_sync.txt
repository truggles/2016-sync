Kicking off data card sync using latest updates to electron ID/Iso WPs and associated scale factors.  Two files provided, 1 with svFit higgs mass incorporated with AMass in the title and another with purely visible mass of all 4 leptons with 4LMass in title.

also adding old WPs and Z boson requirements (pre-Sept12), sorry about wrong binning.  Don't try to align to this binning, this sample can be used to check yield comparisons.

New DCs for SS Higgs with Tight (signal selection) cuts on Higgs leptons.  Please ignore the Reducible Bkg histograms.  They are larger and were not configured correctly.  Please compare Data and MC base backgrounds.

Same as 20 Oct, but no bJet veto
